# U++ Tutorial: Basic Assembly Workflow
# Learn how to use U++ assemblies in VfsShell

# Step 1: Create a new U++ assembly
upp.create MyFirstApp /tmp/myfirst.var

# Step 2: Verify the assembly was created
upp.list
# You should see "MyFirstApp" with a primary package

# Step 3: Create another assembly to see multiple assemblies
upp.create SecondApp /tmp/second.var

# Step 4: List to see both assemblies
upp.list

# This demonstrates the basic U++ workflow:
# - upp.create: Creates a new U++ assembly with a primary package
# - upp.list: Shows all currently loaded assemblies and their packages
# - upp.load: Loads an existing .var file (assembly definition)
# - upp.gui: Opens the U++ IDE interface for development

# The U++ assembly system allows you to manage Ultimate++ projects
# with multiple packages and dependencies directly in VfsShell.
