# Internal U++ Builder Scenario (Draft)

This placeholder tracks the upcoming integration test for the in-process U++ build pipeline.

## Planned Coverage
- Compile a trivial package (single `.cpp`) using the internal toolchain executor.
- Verify dependency expansion (package + dependency package).
- Check dry-run output to ensure command ordering.
- Capture failure path (missing compiler) to confirm error propagation.

Populate with concrete steps once the pipeline is implemented.
