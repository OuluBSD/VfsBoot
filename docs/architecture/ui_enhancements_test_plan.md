# UI Improvements Test Plan

## Test Objectives
Verify that the ncurses UI enhancements have been successfully implemented and function correctly.

## Test Environment
- VfsBoot compiled with CODEX_UI_NCURSES flag
- Terminal with color support
- qwen-code server (either local or remote)

## Test Cases

### 1. Color Support Verification
**Objective**: Verify that colors are properly displayed in the ncurses interface

**Steps**:
1. Start VfsBoot with ncurses support
2. Run `qwen` command to enter ncurses mode
3. Observe the initial welcome message colors:
   - "qwen - AI Assistant (NCurses Mode)" should be cyan
   - Session and model information should be blue
   - Help text should be yellow
4. Send a simple message to qwen
5. Observe message colors:
   - User messages should be green
   - AI responses should be cyan
   - System messages should be yellow

**Expected Results**:
- Colors should be displayed correctly if terminal supports them
- If terminal doesn't support colors, text should display normally without color codes

### 2. Status Bar Verification
**Objective**: Verify that the status bar displays connection information

**Steps**:
1. Start VfsBoot with ncurses support
2. Run `qwen` command to enter ncurses mode
3. Observe the bottom status bar
4. Check that it displays:
   - Connection status (should be "Connected")
   - Current model name
   - Session ID (truncated to 10 characters)

**Expected Results**:
- Status bar should be visible at the bottom
- Information should be correctly displayed
- Status text should be yellow if colors are supported

### 3. Message Handler Color Verification
**Objective**: Verify that all message types use appropriate colors

**Steps**:
1. Start VfsBoot with ncurses support
2. Run `qwen` command to enter ncurses mode
3. Trigger different message types:
   - Send user message and observe color (green)
   - Receive AI response and observe color (cyan)
   - Trigger system message (if possible) and observe color (yellow)
   - Trigger error message (if possible) and observe color (red)
   - Trigger info message (if possible) and observe color (blue)
   - Trigger tool approval request and observe color (magenta)

**Expected Results**:
- Each message type should display with its designated color
- Streaming responses should maintain consistent coloring

### 4. Tool Approval Workflow Verification
**Objective**: Verify that the tool approval workflow uses appropriate colors

**Steps**:
1. Start VfsBoot with ncurses support
2. Run `qwen` command to enter ncurses mode
3. Trigger a tool execution request that requires approval
4. Observe the tool request display:
   - Header should be magenta
   - Tool names should be magenta
   - Confirmation details should be blue
   - Approval prompt should be yellow
   - Approved tools should be green
   - Rejected tools should be red

**Expected Results**:
- Tool approval workflow should be clearly visible with appropriate colors
- User should be able to easily distinguish different elements

### 5. Graceful Degradation Test
**Objective**: Verify that UI works correctly on terminals without color support

**Steps**:
1. Disable color support in terminal (if possible)
2. Start VfsBoot with ncurses support
3. Run `qwen` command to enter ncurses mode
4. Perform the same tests as above
5. Observe that text displays correctly without colors

**Expected Results**:
- UI should function normally without colors
- No visual artifacts or missing text
- All functionality should be preserved

### 6. Performance Test
**Objective**: Verify that color enhancements don't significantly impact performance

**Steps**:
1. Start VfsBoot with ncurses support
2. Run `qwen` command to enter ncurses mode
3. Have a conversation with multiple rapid exchanges
4. Observe responsiveness of the interface
5. Compare with baseline performance (without extensive testing)

**Expected Results**:
- UI should remain responsive
- No noticeable lag in message display
- Colors should not cause performance degradation

## Test Results Template

| Test Case | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Color Support Verification |  |  |
| Status Bar Verification |  |  |
| Message Handler Color Verification |  |  |
| Tool Approval Workflow Verification |  |  |
| Graceful Degradation Test |  |  |
| Performance Test |  |  |

## Success Criteria
- All UI elements display with correct colors when supported
- UI remains fully functional on terminals without color support
- No performance degradation compared to baseline
- All existing functionality preserved
- Enhanced user experience through improved visual feedback

## Rollback Plan
If issues are discovered:
1. Revert the color enhancement changes
2. Restore original UI implementation
3. Investigate root cause of issues
4. Re-implement with fixes
