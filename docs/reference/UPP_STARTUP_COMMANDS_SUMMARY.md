# U++ Startup Commands Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

Three new CLI commands were added to the VfsShell:

1. `upp.startup.load <directory-path>` - Loads all .var files from a directory
2. `upp.startup.list` - Lists all loaded startup assemblies
3. `upp.startup.open <name>` - Loads a specific named startup assembly

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
- `/common/active/sblo/Dev/VfsBoot/VfsShell/main.cpp`

### Key Changes Made

1. Added global storage for startup assemblies:
   ```cpp
   // Global storage for loaded startup assemblies
   std::vector<std::shared_ptr<UppAssembly>> g_startup_assemblies;
   ```

2. Implemented `upp.startup.load` command:
   - Takes a directory path as argument
   - Scans the directory for files ending with `.var` extension
   - Loads each .var file as a U++ assembly using existing parsing functionality
   - Adds successfully loaded assemblies to the global storage vector
   - Creates VFS structure for each assembly

3. Implemented `upp.startup.list` command:
   - Lists all loaded assemblies from the global storage
   - Shows assembly details including packages and marks primary packages

4. Implemented `upp.startup.open` command:
   - Takes an assembly name as argument
   - Searches for the assembly by name in the loaded assemblies
   - Loads the .var file content for the matching assembly
   - Creates VFS structure for the assembly

5. Updated help text to include the new commands

### Technical Approach

The implementation follows the same patterns as existing UPP commands in the codebase:
- Command parsing and argument validation
- Integration with the existing UppAssembly system
- Proper error handling with meaningful error messages
- VFS integration for creating directory structures

## Verification

The implementation was verified by:
1. Successful compilation with no new errors
2. Commands appearing in the help system
3. Commands responding appropriately to input:
   - `upp.startup.list` correctly reports "No startup assemblies loaded" when none are loaded
   - `upp.startup.load` properly handles non-existent directories with error messages
   - `upp.startup.open` correctly identifies when an assembly is not found and provides appropriate error messages

## Benefits

This implementation provides:
- Easy bulk loading of U++ assemblies from a directory
- Centralized management of startup assemblies
- Ability to selectively load individual assemblies by name
- Seamless integration with existing U++ tooling
- Consistent user experience with other UPP commands
