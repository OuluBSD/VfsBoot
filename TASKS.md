## Upcoming: less important

### Shell UX Improvements
- in sub-CLI loops, ctrl+c should exit the loop (like in bash etc)
	- in case of runnin scripts in "run <script>" ctrl+z should exit the script runner (just like in bash etc)
- **Customizable shell prompt prefix with colors**:
  - Current: plain text prompt prefix (e.g. "sblo@Gen2 ~/VfsBoot $")
  - Goal: Programmable prompt like bash $PS1 with ANSI colors
  - Support both bash-style `export VAR=value` and tcsh-style `setenv VAR value`
  - Read `.vfshrc` and `.vfshprofile` startup files on launch
  - Create reference example in `share/` directory with best practices
  - Sub-CLI modes (like `discuss`) should inherit custom prompt prefix
- **Enhanced `ls` command with colors and grid layout**:
  - Default: Grid view with colors by file type (like modern ls)
  - Add `--list` flag for traditional single-column output
  - Add `--long` / `-l` flag for detailed view (size, date, permissions)
  - Color scheme: directories=blue, executables=green, files=default, mounts=cyan
- **Builtin minimal text editor** (IMPORTANT):
  - Implement editor similar to nano/micro/FreeBSD ee
  - Needed for quick file editing without external dependencies
  - Essential for self-contained development workflow
  - Should integrate with VFS (edit both real and virtual files)
- **Command autocompletion improvements**:
  - Current: File/directory path completion only
  - Goal: Command name completion (TAB after partial command)
  - Store commands in VFS paths (like /bin/make) for unified completion
  - Support mounted path completion (recognize mount boundaries)
- **CLI editing improvements**:
  - Add Ctrl+U (clear line before cursor) and Ctrl+K (clear line after cursor)
  - Add Home/End key support for cursor movement
  - Fix non-ASCII input (e.g. 'ä' character does nothing currently)
- **Double-enter bug fixes**:
  - "ai some text" command requires pressing enter twice
  - "ai some message" script needs same fix

### AI Discussion Enhancements
- **User profiling for AI discussions**:
  - Automatically build user preference profile during `discuss` sessions
  - Track patterns: what user always asks separately, repeated concerns, common requests
  - Avoid repeating explanations user already knows
  - Store profile in VFS (e.g. `/env/user_profile.json`)
  - Add `ai.raw.profiling` command for raw discussion mode profiling
  - Use good-faith heuristics to improve AI responses over time
  - Profile persists across sessions, learns user's style and needs
- **Smart plan addition command** (`ai.add.plan`):
  - User provides raw text without needing to know current plan context
  - AI analyzes existing plan hierarchy and locates correct insertion point
  - Opens `discuss` mode if needed for clarification
  - Detects contradictions with existing plan items
  - On conflict: stops, warns user, requests confirmation before adding
  - Shows proposed location and asks for approval: "Add to /plan/subplan/goals? (y/n)"
  - Handles cases: append to existing section, create new section, merge similar items
  - Makes planning collaborative without requiring manual VFS navigation

### Web Server Enhancements (Phase 2)
- **WebSocket terminal functionality**:
  - Current: WebSocket layer exists but not wired to command execution
  - Goal: Full bidirectional terminal I/O (stdin/stdout redirection)
  - Question: Should WebSocket work for me? Needs verification
  - Add comprehensive tests for web browser interactions
  - Challenge: Testing web browser without actual browser (headless Chrome/Playwright?)
- **Session management for web terminal**:
  - Attachable/detachable sessions (like tmux/screen)
  - Persist session state when switching devices
  - Recover session after connection drops (critical for mobile/remote usage)
  - Store session snapshots in VFS for recovery
  - Multiple named sessions per user

### Shell Features
- **Script sourcing**:
  - CLI command: `source <some_script.sh>` (also alias: `. <some_script.sh>`)
- **Commandline argument enhancements**:
  - Add: --llama, --openai, --version/-v, --help/-h, etc.
- **Shell compatibility**:
  - sh compatibility mode
  - Login shell support (commandline -l flag)
  - Evaluate additional flags needed for POSIX compatibility
- **Turing-complete scripting** (DISCUSS FIRST):
  - Goal: Intuitive scripting more like tcsh than bash
  - Need to design syntax and grammar before implementing
  - Should support: conditionals, loops, functions, variables
  - Discuss with user before implementation
- **Path autocompletion**:
  - Recognize mounted paths and complete system paths
  - Handle VFS-to-filesystem boundary crossings

### Advanced Features
- **Netcat-like networking**:
  - Client and server like `nc` command
  - TTY server for CLI remote access
  - Leave room for minimal SSH implementation later
  - Remote command oneliner: single command for remote execution
  - Advanced remote shell integration
  - File transfer like scp (without encryption layers, like nc)
- **Internal logging to VFS**:
  - Some internal logs visible in /log (VFS)
  - Debug trace, command history, error logs
- **AST resolver for multi-language support**:
  - cpp ast node resolver
  - Keep codebase compatible with non-RAII, dynamic memory languages (Java, C#)
  - Add support for: Java, C#, TypeScript, JavaScript, Python
- **Command aliases**:
  - Alias for script functions (e.g. cpp.returni → "cri")
- **Multi-language sexp converters**:
  - sexp ↔ JavaScript converter
  - Also for: Python, PowerShell, Bash, etc.

### Documentation Improvements
- **File type documentation**:
  - Explain different purposes of .sexp, .cx, .cxpkg files
  - Discuss with user if unsure about conventions
  - Write comprehensive docs in README.md and AGENTS.md
  - Create example solution with multiple cxasm & cxpkg packages
  - Include multiple cpp/h files, compile and run successfully
	
## Upcoming: less important or skip altogether
- byte-vm (maybe overkill?) for sexp, or cx script

## Upcoming: important tests
- we should have small real-life examples, where we create "int main()". Then we need something new there couple of times: user -> system -> user -> system interaction; and the system searches and modifies the ast tree.
	- you should plan like 5 progressively more difficult interaction demos
- we should have actual programming project in a directory, with multiple files, which is mounted to the vfs as overlay. the code is kept both in persistent vfs-file and as cpp/h/Makefile files

- `AGENTS.md` drafted from discussion notes to document VfsShell agent scope.
- Build tooling pipeline now operational:
  - Root `Makefile` builds the VfsShell binary and exposes debug/release toggles.
  - OpenAI integration loads the API key from the home directory fallback (`~/openai-key.txt`).
  - `make sample` exercises the C++ AST builder, exports generated code, compiles it, and checks the runtime output.
- VfsShell harness (`tools/test_harness.py`) runs `.sexp` specs end-to-end against configured LLM targets and validates results inside codex-mini.
- C++ AST shell surface now includes statements (`cpp.vardecl`, `cpp.expr`, `cpp.stmt`, `cpp.return`, `cpp.rangefor`) for structural codegen beyond canned print/return helpers.
- overlays: multiple persistent VFS overlays can now coexist without mixing nodes; the CLI exposes `overlay.*` commands and aggregate listings.

## Backlog / Ideas
- Harden string escaping in the C++ AST dumper before expanding code generation.
- VfsNode memory optimization: keep VfsNode POD-friendly (trivially copyable), implement fast recycler for construction/destruction (hot code path)
- Node metadata storage: separate from VfsNode to maintain POD compatibility (VFS-owned map pattern)
