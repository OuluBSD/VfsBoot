# Tasks Tracker
Note: sexp is for AI and shell script is for human user (+ ai called via sexp). This follows the classic codex behaviour.

## Upcoming: web browser gui: important
- **PLANNING COMPLETE** - Ready for implementation
- Architecture:
	- Backend: C++ with Crow or Boost.Beast for HTTP server
		- Development: Standalone server on localhost:8080 (./codex --web-server --port 8080)
		- Production standalone: Same binary with --serve-static flag for bundled frontend

		- Interactive modes: Run in terminal, View code (Monaco editor), Step-by-step with explanations
		- Preset tours: "New to VfsBoot" (16min), "Advanced Developer", "AI Integration"
	- **Internal System Visualization** (debugging-level, NOT eye candy):

	- Image handling for AI vision tasks (upload/display/annotate)
	- Form-based interfaces for multi-step plan editing and hypothesis refinement

	
## Upcoming: important (in order)
- add in-binary sample runner command `sample.run`
	- register `sample.run` in the shell command dispatcher so demos/tests can call it directly
	- reset `/astcpp/demo`, `/cpp/demo.cpp`, and `/logs/sample.*` before each run for deterministic state
	- construct the demo translation unit via C++ AST helpers and mirror the existing "Hello" program steps internally
	- dump the generated source back into `/cpp/demo.cpp` to keep user export workflows intact
	- locate the host compiler (from `/env/compiler`, env var, or default `c++`) and compile to a temporary executable
	- capture compiler stdout/stderr into VFS logs (`/logs/sample.compile.out`, `/logs/sample.compile.err`)
	- execute the compiled binary, recording output into `/logs/sample.run.out`, `/logs/sample.run.err`
	- write a status node (e.g. `/env/sample.status`) summarizing success/failure, exit codes, and timings
	- propagate failure by returning non-zero exit codes when compilation or execution fails
	- accept optional flags such as `--keep` or `--trace` for temp retention and verbose diagnostics
	- update documentation and scripts to reference `sample.run`, replacing the Makefile's external pipeline
	- extend automated tests to invoke `sample.run` and validate status/output log contents
- make
- parse (libclang): import clang test suite files to vfs
	- also collect what preprocessor sees

## Upcoming: less important
- commandline arguments: --llama, --openai, --version/-v, --help/-h, etc.
- explain different causes of sexp, cx, cxpkg files. discuss with me of them if you're unsure. write to README.md and AGENTS.md
	- make a solution with multiple cxasm & cxpkg packages, which all have multiple cpp and h files. compile and run it succesfully
- CLI home + end button usage while editing prompt
- when I press 'ä', it does nothing. fix it
- when I type "ai some message", I need to push enter twice instead of once
- sh compatibility, login shell (commandline -l), evaluate first if some additional flags are needed
- turing complete script (like bash, csh). Let's talk about syntax and grammar before implementing. I do want to have intuitive scripting and more like tcsh
- netcat -like client and server. Also like tty server for CLI. Have room for minimal SSH later
	- also oneliner for remote computer usage; one line would some "remote" command or something; advanced remote shell integration
	- also filetransfer like scp (but like nc = without additional layers (encryption etc.))
- some internal logs visible in /log (vfs)
- CLI autocomplete with tab
- ncurses (+ windows etc alternative) minimal text editor
- resolver for cpp ast nodes
	- keeping the codebase compatible with non-raii, dynamic memory typed languages, like java & C#
- add support for java & c# & typescript & javascript & python
- alias for script functions; e.g. cpp.returni could be like "cri"
- sexp to javascript to sexp converter
	- also for python, powershell, bash, etc.
	
## Upcoming: less important or skip altogether
- byte-vm (maybe overkill?) for sexp, or cx script

## Upcoming: important tests
- we should have small real-life examples, where we create "int main()". Then we need something new there couple of times: user -> system -> user -> system interaction; and the system searches and modifies the ast tree.
	- you should plan like 5 progressively more difficult interaction demos
- we should have actual programming project in a directory, with multiple files, which is mounted to the vfs as overlay. the code is kept both in persistent vfs-file and as cpp/h/Makefile files

    - Only applies to solution packages, NOT standalone .vfs files
    - Background thread with dirty-flag tracking
  - Crash recovery snapshot framework (every 3 minutes to `.vfsh/recovery.vfs`)
  - Makefile updated to link libblake3
  - Note: Autosave thread startup and VFS write hooks still need integration in main()
## Completed
- **Test harness C++ compilation and execution** (2025-10-07):
  - test_harness.py now compiles generated C++ code using g++/c++ with -std=c++17 -O2
  - Added Linux sandbox execution using unshare (Gentoo-style) with timeout fallback for non-privileged environments
  - Implemented runtime output validation with `expected-runtime-output` field supporting contains/not-contains/equals assertions
  - All test .sexp files updated with runtime expectations for program output verification
  - Tests now verify actual program behavior (compilation + execution), not just AST structure
  - Sandbox provides network/PID namespace isolation on Linux, gracefully falls back to timeout-only when privileges unavailable
  - Compile timeout: 30s, execution timeout: 10s with automatic temp file cleanup
- Renamed Stage1 to VfsShell and updated all references (Makefile, header guards, documentation, test harness)
- Created VfsShell/AGENTS.md documenting implementation architecture (VFS design, S-expression language, C++ AST builder, AI bridge, code organization with line numbers, extension points)
- Linked VfsShell/AGENTS.md from root AGENTS.md under "Implementation details" section
- Created HOWTO_SCRIPTS.md with comprehensive examples for running all script files (.cx vs .sexp, running all scripts, creating custom scripts, common patterns, debugging)
- test_harness.py now uses AI response caching compatible with C++ cache format (cache/ai/{provider}/{hash}-in.txt and {hash}-out.txt)
- add shell commands ctrl+u and ctrl+k for clearing text
- AI bridge prompt & tests: added scripts/examples/ai-hello-world.sexp and tests/011-ai-bridge-hello.sexp to exercise cpp.* helpers via the ai command.
- `AGENTS.md` drafted from discussion notes to document VfsShell agent scope.
- Build tooling pipeline now operational:
  - Root `Makefile` builds the VfsShell binary and exposes debug/release toggles.
  - OpenAI integration loads the API key from the home directory fallback (`~/openai-key.txt`).
  - `make sample` exercises the C++ AST builder, exports generated code, compiles it, and checks the runtime output.
- VfsShell harness (`tools/test_harness.py`) runs `.sexp` specs end-to-end against configured LLM targets and validates results inside codex-mini.
- C++ AST shell surface now includes statements (`cpp.vardecl`, `cpp.expr`, `cpp.stmt`, `cpp.return`, `cpp.rangefor`) for structural codegen beyond canned print/return helpers.
- overlays: multiple persistent VFS overlays can now coexist without mixing nodes; the CLI exposes `overlay.*` commands and aggregate listings.

## Backlog / Ideas
- Harden string escaping in the C++ AST dumper before expanding code generation.
- VfsNode memory optimization: keep VfsNode POD-friendly (trivially copyable), implement fast recycler for construction/destruction (hot code path)
- Node metadata storage: separate from VfsNode to maintain POD compatibility (VFS-owned map pattern)
