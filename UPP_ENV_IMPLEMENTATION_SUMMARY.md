# UPP Environment Variable Processing Implementation Summary

## Problem
The VfsBoot system was not automatically mounting directories and loading .var files from paths specified in the UPP environment variable, which should work similarly to the existing `upp.load.host` command but automatically at startup.

## Solution
Added automatic processing of the UPP environment variable during VfsShell initialization:

### Features Implemented:
1. **Environment Variable Parsing**: Splits UPP on ':' to handle multiple directories
2. **Directory Validation**: Checks that each path exists and is a directory
3. **VFS Mounting**: Mounts each directory to a unique VFS path
4. **Recursive Scanning**: Scans directories and subdirectories for .var files
5. **Assembly Loading**: Loads each found .var file as a startup assembly
6. **Integration**: Works seamlessly with existing `upp.startup.*` commands

### Key Implementation Details:
- Located in `VfsShell/main.cpp` initialization section
- Uses `vfs.mountFilesystem()` to mount host directories
- Implements recursive directory traversal to find .var files
- Properly initializes `UppAssembly` objects with correct paths
- Handles error conditions gracefully with informative messages

### Verification:
Tests confirm that:
1. Single directory in UPP environment variable works correctly
2. Multiple directories separated by ':' work correctly
3. .var files in subdirectories are properly detected and loaded
4. Loaded assemblies appear in `upp.startup.list` output
5. Assemblies can be opened with `upp.startup.open` command
6. Error handling works for non-existent or invalid paths

## Usage
Set the UPP environment variable to one or more colon-separated directory paths:
```bash
export UPP="/path/to/first/directory:/path/to/second/directory"
./codex
```

The system will automatically mount these directories and load any .var files found within them.
